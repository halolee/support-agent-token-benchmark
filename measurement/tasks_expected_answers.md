# Tasks — expected answers (answer key)

This document is the human-derived answer key for `measurement/tasks.jsonl`. It exists separately from the JSONL so it stays editable for adjudication of LLM-as-judge disputes without polluting the frozen task schema. The validator enforces 1:1 parity between task IDs in `tasks.jsonl` and `## TASK-ID` headings here.

**Format per entry:**
- One `## TASK-ID` heading per task (heading must match exactly).
- Verbatim quote(s) from `corpus/swiss_faq.md` supporting any policy claim.
- SQL queries (if the task touches `data/travel.sqlite`) used to derive the expected transactional answer.
- Notes on adversarial intent (EDGE tasks) so future maintainers do not "fix" them as bugs.

## POL-001

**Task:** A friend told me I can pay for my flight after I take it instead of upfront — is that something I'd qualify for?

**Expected behaviour:** The agent recognises this as a pay-per-invoice question and surfaces the three eligibility conditions. Best-form responses ask qualifying follow-up questions (age, residence, route) before asserting eligibility, because the customer's user_message contains none of that information.

**Corpus support** — verbatim from `corpus/swiss_faq.md` `## Pay per invoice`:

> Who can use "Pay per invoice"?
> You must be over 18 years old and be a resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein. Furthermore, this payment option is only available for flights from Switzerland.

**Failure modes to penalise:**
- Asserting eligibility without checking the three conditions.
- Inventing additional eligibility criteria (e.g., credit score thresholds, frequent-flyer tier requirements) — these are not in the corpus.
- Citing the wrong section (e.g., `## Credit Cards` or `## Frequently asked questions: Payment`) instead of `## Pay per invoice`.
